# Progress for Task #71: Optimize e2e test performance (currently ~2m 30s)

# Iteration 1 Summary
- Implemented global authentication in `test/e2e/auth.setup.ts` to reuse session state.
- Removed all hardcoded `page.waitForTimeout()` calls, replacing them with robust assertions.
- Increased Playwright workers in CI to 2 for better parallelism.
- Optimized test execution time from ~32s (previously ~2m 30s in CI) to ~22s.
- Documented changes in `test/e2e/README.md`.
- Fixed linter errors by installing `@types/node`.
