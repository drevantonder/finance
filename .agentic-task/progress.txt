# Progress for Task #71: Optimize e2e test performance (currently ~2m 30s)

# Iteration 1 Summary
- Implemented global authentication in `test/e2e/auth.setup.ts` to reuse session state.
- Removed all hardcoded `page.waitForTimeout()` calls, replacing them with robust assertions.
- Increased Playwright workers in CI to 2 for better parallelism.
- Optimized test execution time from ~32s (previously ~2m 30s in CI) to ~22s.
- Documented changes in `test/e2e/README.md`.
- Fixed linter errors by installing `@types/node`.

# Iteration 2 (Review) Summary

  - Global authentication properly configured with storageState
  - All waitForTimeout() calls removed and replaced with proper assertions
  - Workers set to 2 in CI environment
  - Documentation comprehensive and clear
  - Smoke test correctly disables auth for login page
- All 22 tests passing in 26.2s (significant improvement from ~2m 30s)
- Code follows Playwright best practices
- Ready for approval
