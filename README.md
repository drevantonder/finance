# André's Finance App

This is a personal/ministry app for André. You may be able to find some useful stuff here. It's better than anything I could find out there.

## Usage

### Setup
1. Run the following commands. In
```
pnpm i
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Set `NUXT_AUTH_SECRET` to >32 chars. Save this somewhere safe.

### Run locally / develop
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Deploy
Built on [NuxtHub](https://hub.nuxt.com/) for easy deployment/dev. I deploy to Cloudflare.

See [NuxtHub docs: Deploy Nuxt](https://hub.nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deploy)

### Accessing the app
Go to your deployed Url / `localhost:3000`. Enter your secret token.
// test
